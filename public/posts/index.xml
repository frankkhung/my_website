      <description>Abstract This post talks about the delays caused by different incidents using some data manipulations and data visualization techniques. Specifically, we used bar-charts to graph out detailed delay counts based on Incidents and Incident-Minute relationship. We see that mechanical error induced delays had the most counts, while Diversions had the most extended delay times. With this information and the possible waiting time (average time) for each incident, the TTC customers can change their plans with some flexibility.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>
