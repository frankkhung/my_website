Abstract This post talks about the delays caused by different incidents using some data manipulations and data visualization techniques. Specifically, we used bar-charts to graph out detailed delay counts based on Incidents and Incident-Minute relationship. We see that mechanical error induced delays had the most counts, while Diversions had the most extended delay times.</description>
